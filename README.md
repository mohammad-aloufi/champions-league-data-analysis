# The Champions League: A data analysis

## motivation

I've done this project in the data scientest course from udacity. The project is in 2 parts:

1. I wrote a blog post about my findings and it can be found [here](https://mohammad-aloufi.github.io/2021/10/24/The-Champions-League-,-A-look-from-a-data-perspective.html)
2. This repo and it contains all the code for the project.

# Why the champions league?

Since I was given the opportunity to choose my own dataset, the first thing that came to mind is a dataset that's about something I like, and that's football.

Football matches are sometimes about the stats, sometimes they make a difference though, sometimes they don't.

Stats and my love for football is what made me pick [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mcarujo/uefa-champions-league-20202021/tasks) for data analysis and to see what kind of interesting things I could find.
