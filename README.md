# The Champions League: A data analysis

## motivation

This project is in 2 parts:

1. I wrote a blog post about my findings and it can be found [here](https://mohammad-aloufi.github.io/2021/10/24/The-Champions-League-,-A-look-from-a-data-perspective.html)
2. This repo and it contains all the code for the project.

Football matches are sometimes about the stats, sometimes they make a difference though, sometimes they don't.

Stats and my love for football is what made me pick the champions league dataset for data analysis and to see what kind of interesting things I could find.

Since there are a lot of stats we always keep track of durring a match, it really is motivating to me as a data scientest and someone who loves football to try and investigate things further and see what else those stats can tell me beyond the obvious.
